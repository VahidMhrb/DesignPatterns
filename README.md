# Design Patterns

Commonly used **Design Patterns**

## What's a design pattern?
**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## The Catalog of Design Patterns

### Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
